We want to be free to offer our clients the best advice for their needs and their context.\n#### Generalis\nA generalist, with knowledge on a broad range of issues, can see deeper inside the interconnectedness and find solutions that a specialist might not be able to. Companies often have the specialist that know their busienss best. All the different departments within a business do connect with each other. A generalist can help see this bigger picture and come up with ideas and solutions that benefit the business as a whole.\n#### Advisory Service\nOur *will to power* is less than the our *will to meaning*. We find meaning in helping others help themselves. The need for a consultant should be temporary and we strive to enable our clients to own the path to success.",
