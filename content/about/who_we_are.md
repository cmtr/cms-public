## Your Independent Generalist Advisory Service

We define ourself as a *Your Independent Generalist Advisory Service* but what do actually mean by this. We will here go into details on each point.

#### Independent
By being independent we are not bound to any limitations - corporate self-interest - in the advice and support we provide. We want to be free to offer our advisors the liberty to offer clients advice, according to their experience and background, best fits their needs and context. 

This independence is reflected in our company valeus as _Take **Ownership**_ and _always act with **Integrity**_.

#### Generalist
As generalists we stive to have knowledge on a broad range of issues. This so we can see the interconnectedness between domains and find solutions that a specialist might not be able to. Companies often have the specialist that know their busienss best, but all the different departments within a business do connect with each other. A generalist can help see this bigger picture and come up with ideas and solutions that benefit the business as a whole.

*In a fast-changing workplace, transferable skills are becoming increasingly important. Generalists tend to posses more transferable skills.*

The generalist approach is reflected in our company's values as _be **Curious** to all things_ and _**Dive Deep** in to the matter_.

#### Advisory Service
*A consultancy firm usually provides expertice and solves business problems, or develops a business as a whole.* We like to focus on providing advice, expertice and support to enable the business itself solve the problem or develop itself as a whole. We believe the ownership for the business fate should lay within it's own hands. One could say that our *will to power* is less than the our *will to meaning*. And to close the circile of the *Schools of Pshycotherapy*, we derive our *will to pleasure* by enabling others to help themselves while continiually enhancing our own knowledge and experience.. 

The advisory perspective is reflected in our company's values as *Be nice to **People** and **Inspire** greatness in others*.

*A consultant provides expertise and solves business problems, or develops a business as a whole. A consultant deals with the overall organization or specific parts of it and not individuals within it. Consultants only indirectly affect individuals.* [ICC -What is Coaching?](https://internationalcoachingcommunity.com/what-is-coaching/)
