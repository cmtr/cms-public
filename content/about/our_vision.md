# Our Vision

Our vision is _**To be the prefered advisory service that our clients come back to time and again**_. 

We strive to help our clients become self sufficent through their times of uncertainty. Then come back to us again when new times of change and unfamiliarity come.

### Who are we helping
Our target clients is business and organizations that are highly specialized or facing unfamiliar situations. 

Their speciality is their strenght and should continiue to be so, but sometimes it comes at the cost of agility and perspective when facing unfamiliar challanges that lie outside their area of speciality.

### How are we helping
We love new challanges and we know how to face the unknown, unfamiliar and stange. 

We know that just because something is new to you, doesn't mean it new to everyone. We help our clients by assiting them in the search for what their problem truely is, finding who has solve the problem in the past and how they did it, and in the end helping them address it in their organization themselves. 

We stive to make our clients independent of us. _Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime._ If we done the job right, they will come back to us when the environment necessitates that fishing must be supplimented by hunting.

> *“Favoring specialization over intelligence is exactly wrong, especially in high tech. The world is changing so fast across every industry and endeavor that it's a given the role for which you're hiring is going to change. Yesterday's widget will be obsolete tomorrow, and hiring a specialist in such a dynamic environment can backfire. A specialist brings an inherent bias to solving problems that spawns from the very expertise that is his putative advantage, and may be threatened by a new type of solution that requires new expertise. A smart generalist doesn't have bias, so is free to survey the wide range of solutions and gravitate to the best one.”*
